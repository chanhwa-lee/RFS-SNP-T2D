 Repository for the project "Recommended Food Score (RFS) â€‘ SNP interaction on Type 2 Diabetes Survival Time"

- Fit Cox proportional hazards model to assess interaction effect between RFS and SNP on type 2 diabetes survival time in R
- Performed pathway analysis and identified two KEGG pathways related with type 2 diabetes with consideration of RFS using PLINK and MAGMA
